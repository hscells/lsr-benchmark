# Tutorials for the lsr-benchmark

This directory contains a set of hands-on tutorials to kick-start the development and evaluation of learned sparse retrieval systems with the [lsr-benchmark](..).

You can run the tutorials in Github Codespaces or Google Colab.

## Recommended Order of the Tutorials

As the tutorials cover content of different stages of the `lsr-benchmark`, we recommend that you start with basic tutorials:

1. [tutorial-pre-computed-resources.ipynb](tutorial-pre-computed-resources.ipynb). Provides an overview of the pre-computed resources of the `lsr-benchmark` that you can re-use for your experiments and how to load and evaluate them.
2. [tutorial-retrieval-engines.ipynb](tutorial-retrieval-engines.ipynb). **(Attention: In Progress.)** Shows the basic interface that retrieval engines in the lsr-benchmark should fulfill and how you can evaluate your own implementations against existing runs.
3. [tutorial-embedding-models.ipynb](tutorial-embedding-models.ipynb). **(Attention: In Progress.)** Shows the basic interface that embedding systems in the lsr-benchmark should fulfill and how you can evaluate your own embeddings against existing ones.
